# This file defines a tree decomposition (or join tree) used to compute the queries. 
# 
# 1) First line, gives number_of_attributes, number_of_relations, and number_of_edges. 
#
# 2) The we list each attribute in the join tree using the following order:  
#    attribute_id name type 
#
#	- The attribute_id is used to identify this attribute later on, and should be
# 	  ordered from 0 to number_of_attributes-1.
#
#   - The join attributes must come first in the provided order. 
#
# 3) List each relation_name in the join tree using the following order:
#    relation_id name:[list of attributes in relation]
#
#   - The attributes in the list need to be comma separated without spaces 
#
# 4) List each edge in the join tree using the following notation:  
#    relation_name-relation_name
#
#   - Again assuming no relations 
#
# 5) For each relation, list the number of threads used for to process each relation
#   - A zero value would be converted into a single thread
